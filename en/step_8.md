+ **Try another device.** Instead of just a fan and a lamp, can you add another device to your smart classroom?

+ **Try different confidence limits.** Is 70% the right threshold to use to decide whether the computer has recognised the command? Experiment with different values until you have a value that works well for your machine learning model. 

If you choose a number that is too high, the computer will say “Sorry I’m not sure what you mean” too often. 

If you choose a number that is too low, the computer will get too many things wrong.

**Do it for real!** Have a look at the smart assistants that developers have made for Amazon’s Alexa : [http://amzn.to/2sxy1hw](http://amzn.to/2sxy1hw) 
 
Developers made these in the same way that you did this project – creating labels for the commands they wanted it to recognise, and then collecting examples of how those commands might be phrased to train the Alexa to be able to understand them. 
 
Find an Alexa Skill that you think sounds good. Look at the commands it can understand – can you think how you could’ve trained it?
