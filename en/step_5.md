## Training and testing your machine learning model

+ Click on the **< Back to project** link, then click **Learn & Test**

+ Click on the **Train new machine learning model** button. As long as you’ve collected enough examples, the computer should start to learn how to recognise commands from the examples you’ve written.

Wait for the training to complete. This might take a minute or two. While waiting, try to complete the machine-learning multi-choice quiz at the bottom of the page.

Once the training has completed, a Test box will be displayed. Try testing your machine learning model to see what it has learned. 
+ Type in a command, and press enter. It should be recognised. Test it with examples that you haven’t shown the computer before. 
If you’re not happy with how the computer recognises the messages, go back to the previous step and add some more examples. 
Make sure you repeat this step to train with the new examples though!

You’ve started to train a computer to recognise commands. 
Instead of writing rules to do this, you are doing it by collecting examples. These examples are being used to train a machine learning “model”. 
This is called “supervised learning” because of the way you are supervising the computer’s training.
The computer will learn from patterns in the examples you’ve given it, such as the choice of words, and the way sentences are structured.  These will be used to be able to recognise commands.
