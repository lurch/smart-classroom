You’ve modified your Scratch smart classroom assistant to use machine learning instead of your earlier rules-based approach. 
Training the computer to be able to recognise instructions for itself should be much quicker than trying to make a list of every possible command. 
The more examples you give it, the better it should get at recognising instructions correctly.
